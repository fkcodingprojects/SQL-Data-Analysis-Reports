# Data Analysis of Taxi Data using SQL

In this SQL script, we perform data analysis on a table named 'merged_data' to gain insights into taxi trip data. The analysis covers various aspects of taxi trips, such as pickup and drop-off locations, fare amounts, activity during different hours of the day, and trip statistics based on weather conditions.

## Most Common Pickup and Drop-off Locations with Hourly Breakdown

The first SQL query identifies the most common pickup and drop-off locations for each hour, along with the percentage of trips they represent during that hour.

## Average Fare Amount on Weekdays and Weekends

The second SQL query calculates the average fare amount for each hour on weekdays and weekends. This allows us to explore fare variations during different times of the day and days of the week.

## Busiest Pickup Locations and Their Average Activity during Different Hours

The third SQL query focuses on the busiest pickup locations and their average trip count and total fare amount during different hours of the day.

## Average Trip Count and Total Fare per Hour for Different Humidity Ranges

The fourth SQL query calculates the average trip count and total fare per hour for different humidity ranges: Low Humidity, Moderate Humidity, and High Humidity. This analysis helps understand the relationship between weather conditions and taxi trips.

## Average Trip Count and Total Fare per Hour for Different Temperature Ranges

The fifth SQL query calculates the average trip count and total fare per hour for different temperature ranges: Low Temperature, Moderate Temperature, and High Temperature. This analysis provides insights into the impact of temperature on taxi activity.

By running these SQL queries, we can gain valuable insights into taxi trip data, helping transportation companies and policymakers make informed decisions.

Note: Ensure that the table and column names match your specific data setup for accurate results.
