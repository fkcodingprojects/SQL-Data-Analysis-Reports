# Data Analysis of Data Scientists using SQL

In this SQL script, we perform data analysis on a table named 'salaries' to gain insights into the salaries, experience levels, company locations, employment types, and company sizes of data scientists.

## Average Salary per Experience Level

The first SQL query calculates the average salary for each experience level using the 'salaries' table. The results provide valuable information about the salary distribution across different experience levels.

## Average Salary per Experience Level and per Company Location

The second SQL query extends the analysis by calculating the average salary for each experience level and company location combination. This allows us to explore salary variations based on both experience and company location.

## Employment Type Probability per Company Location

The third SQL query focuses on the probability distribution of employment types for each experience level and company location. It calculates the count and probability of each employment type within a specific experience level and company location.

## Count of Company Size per Company Location

The fourth SQL query counts the occurrence of each company size in each company location. It provides insights into the distribution of company sizes across different locations.

## Count of Employment Type per Company Location

The fifth SQL query counts the occurrence of each employment type in each company location. This analysis helps us understand the distribution of employment types among different company locations.

By running these SQL queries, we can perform a comprehensive data analysis of data scientists, enabling us to understand salary trends, employment types, and company sizes across different experience levels and company locations.

Note: Ensure that the table and column names match your specific data setup for accurate results.
